NVDA Controller Client DLL Setup
=================================

To enable direct NVDA screen reader control from OpenLink Remote Desktop,
you need to obtain the NVDA Controller Client DLL files.

Download Location
-----------------
The DLL files are available from the official NVDA repository:
https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/tree/master/extras/controllerClient

Or download from NV Access directly:
https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/releases/

After downloading an NVDA release, the DLLs are in:
- Program Files\NVDA\lib\nvdaControllerClient32.dll (32-bit)
- Program Files\NVDA\lib64\nvdaControllerClient64.dll (64-bit)

Installation
------------
1. Copy nvdaControllerClient32.dll to: native/win32/
2. Copy nvdaControllerClient64.dll to: native/win64/

Dependencies
------------
On Windows, you'll also need to install these npm packages:
  npm install ffi-napi ref-napi

These packages require node-gyp and a C++ compiler:
  - Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows)
  - Or: npm install --global windows-build-tools

Alternative Method
------------------
If you can't use the native DLL, OpenLink will fall back to:
1. ARIA live regions for screen reader announcements
2. Local browser speech synthesis (speechSynthesis API)

DLL Functions Used
------------------
- nvdaController_testIfRunning() - Check if NVDA is running
- nvdaController_speakText(text) - Speak text through NVDA
- nvdaController_cancelSpeech() - Stop current speech
- nvdaController_brailleMessage(text) - Display on braille device
